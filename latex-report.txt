\section{INTRODUCTION}
\setstretch{1.3}
Cardiovascular diseases, particularly incidents of heart attacks, represent a critical global health concern, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality rates. Despite advancements in medical science, accurately predicting an individual's susceptibility to a heart attack remains a complex challenge. This research seeks to address this challenge by harnessing the capabilities of artificial neural networks, offering a novel approach to enhance predictive accuracy.\\\

In the domain of computer science engineering, the integration of advanced technologies into healthcare has become paramount. Artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain's learning processes, provide a powerful tool for pattern recognition and prediction. This research endeavors to push the boundaries of this technology by introducing a multimodal neural network that can seamlessly process two distinct types of medical data: tabular blood reports in .xlsx format and electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets.\\

The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize heart attack prediction by amalgamating diverse but complementary sources of health information. By combining the quantitative insights from blood reports with the temporal and waveform data from ECGs, the proposed model aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's cardiovascular health. This not only contributes to the advancement of computer science in healthcare applications but also addresses a crucial gap in preventive medicine.\\\

Furthermore, the flexibility of the proposed model is highlighted, as it is designed to accommodate either blood reports or ECG data independently. However, the true innovation lies in its ability to achieve heightened accuracy when both datasets are available, paving the way for a holistic and integrated approach to heart attack prediction. In a world where healthcare resources are often strained, the potential impact of an accurate and efficient predictive model is immense, enabling timely interventions and personalized healthcare strategies. This research, therefore, stands at the intersection of computer science, healthcare, and preventive medicine, aiming to provide a transformative solution to a pressing global health challenge.

\section{\MakeUppercase{Research Problem}}
\setlength{\parindent}{0em}
Cardiovascular diseases, especially heart attacks, stand as a predominant global health challenge. The difficulty in predicting the occurrence of a heart attack with precision remains a critical problem. This research project addresses this challenge by proposing a solution based on artificial neural networks. Specifically, the research aims to develop a multimodal neural network capable of handling two distinct types of inputs – tabular blood reports in .xlsx format and ECG datasets – with a focus on achieving heightened accuracy when both datasets are available.\\

The choice of this research problem is grounded in the urgent need for more accurate and nuanced methods of predicting heart attacks, a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Conventional risk assessment models often lack the depth required for early and precise detection. The integration of blood reports and ECG data into a single, flexible model is motivated by the complementary nature of these datasets. Blood reports offer comprehensive biochemical insights, while ECG data captures vital cardiac activity patterns.\\

The significance of this problem is underscored by the potential to revolutionize preventive healthcare. Timely prediction of heart attacks allows for proactive interventions, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and improving patient outcomes. By addressing the limitations of existing models and leveraging the capabilities of artificial neural networks, this research seeks to contribute to the development of a sophisticated yet accessible tool for accurate heart attack prediction.\\

In essence, the research problem is chosen not only for its scientific and technological challenges but, more importantly, for its potential real-world impact on public health. The proposed multimodal neural network represents a step towards personalized and efficient healthcare, aligning with the broader goals of enhancing preventive medicine in the era of advanced computational methodologies.

\section{\MakeUppercase{Literature Review}}
\textbf{Multimodal learning using convolution neural network and Sparse Autoencoder: }\\In this study, they created a system to classify patterns using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and sparse autoencoders (SAE), bringing together information from MRI and FDG-PET scans. Their main goal was to compare this fusion approach with using each scan alone, emphasizing the benefits of combining different types of information. The experiments showed that the method effectively captures local 3D patterns from both MRI and FDG-PET, and it significantly improves the accuracy of Alzheimer's disease prediction compared to using each scan separately. This improvement was observed in both the fusion of modalities and when using CNN with pretraining from SAE. In the future, they could enhance our approach by refining how to select patches during the autoencoder training step. There is also room for overall performance improvement in these systems with further advancements.\\

\textbf{Multimodal Deep Neural Network with Image Sequence Features for Video Captioning:}\\This research paper focuses on the challenge of automatically describing video clips, which has applications in areas like video search, interaction with machines, and aiding physically handicapped individuals. The authors compare the effectiveness of a model called S2VT with a recently proposed approach called NeuralTalk2 for image captioning. S2VT uses a sequence-to-sequence model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to process video frames and generate textual descriptions. While effective, S2VT sometimes produces inaccurate sentences, possibly due to limited data. To address this, the authors integrate S2VT with NeuralTalk2 to create MDNNiSF, aiming to improve accuracy by leveraging additional image caption data. The paper suggests that combining these approaches can enhance video captioning accuracy and presents experimental results using Microsoft Research datasets.
